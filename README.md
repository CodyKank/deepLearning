#Deep Learning Project

* This is a repo for a possible avenue for the deep learning project.
** If you are not a member of the group, in its current state this repo will not help you.

* The idea is to take an image and fit a model to discover the function mapping of the gray-
  scale values to the color values.

* Currently, trial.py within this repo is a very rough outline that will do that.

* erroneously, it was created for 225x225 images, and it is very difficult to change the model
  output size so for testing and planning stages it only takes 225x225 of an image. In theory
  we could just show images of 225x225.
